task: >
  You have been given subsampled ATAC-seq data from the SCLC study.  
  This task is scoped to a single paired-end sample (SRX26680000, FFPE Never-met primary tumor).  
  Using the provided FASTQ files and generated outputs, answer the following biological questions.
questions:
- id: q1
  stage: quality_control
  text: After adapter removal, what percentage of reads passed filtering in sample
    SRX26680000?
  answer_type: numeric_percent
  tolerance: 0.5
- id: q2
  stage: alignment
  text: How many properly paired primary reads are mapped (excluding QC-fail and duplicates)
    in SRX26680000?
  answer_type: integer_exact
  tolerance: 1000
- id: q3
  stage: quality_control
  text: What is the duplication rate (percent) reported by fastp for SRX26680000?
  answer_type: numeric_percent
  tolerance: 0.5
- id: q4
  stage: peak_calling
  text: How many significant peaks were called by MACS (narrowPeak) for SRX26680000?
  answer_type: integer_exact
- id: q5
  stage: qc
  text: What is the FRiP (Fraction of Reads in Peaks, percent) for SRX26680000?
  answer_type: numeric_percent
  tolerance: 1.0
