task: 'You have been given subsampled ATAC-seq data from an FFPE primary SCLC tumor
  (SRX26680000). Using the provided paired-end FASTQs and generated outputs, answer:'
questions:
- id: q1
  stage: quality_control
  text: After adapter removal, what percentage of reads passed filtering?
  answer_type: numeric_percent
  tolerance: 0.5
- id: q2
  stage: alignment
  text: How many properly paired, primary, mapped, non-duplicate nuclear reads are
    in the sample?
  answer_type: integer_exact
  tolerance_note: "\xB11% or \xB15,000 reads (whichever is larger)."
- id: q3
  stage: quality_control
  text: What is the library duplication rate (percent) reported by fastp?
  answer_type: numeric_percent
  tolerance: 0.2
- id: q4
  stage: peak_calling
  text: How many significant peaks were called by MACS (narrowPeak)?
  answer_type: integer_exact
  tolerance_note: "\xB12% (min \xB1200 peaks)."
- id: q5
  stage: qc
  text: What is the FRiP (Fraction of Reads in Peaks, percent) using blacklist-filtered
    peaks and properly paired, primary, mapped, non-duplicate reads?
  answer_type: numeric_percent
